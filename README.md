# Cuty

 Cuty project started on 17/3/31 , It is a Node.js framework driven by MVC and Middlewares.

 Different from `koa` or `express`, Cuty combines MVC and middleware workflow to build Node.js apps.

 As Node.js is a async/IO runtime, most of Node.js framework uses stream-like middlewares to

 frame apps, These apps are great.

 But we should realize a fact that stream-like middlewares are not structured.

 Developers have to deal with the handle logic to decide whethor or not to let the middleware

 handle the logic, also app's shape is not suited with too many middlewares arranged in flatten mode.

 This is the most reason why Cuty is designed.
